## LIB IMS
This Paper makes use of the `ims_lib`, a helper library for easy dealing with the IMS datasets. You can find the repository here:
https://github.com/Mereep/lib_ims

It can be directly installed using `pip` with: 
- `pip install git+https://github.com/Mereep/lib_ims` 
- (or, better use the included `requirements.txt`): `pip install -r requirements.txt`

The dataset identifier for the data used in the paper is `ims_racing_prime` and can be downloaded using the library.
